pandas implementation using two datasets


There are 2 csv files provided here, first file is 'status_details.csv' which is item level details for all the Order Id. Second file is 'status.csv' contains the status of each of the order Id. First of all create a new dataframe by adding the column 'status' from 'status.csv' in the 'status_details.csv'. After creating this new dataframe, solve the below problems and submit back the results along with the python notebook (mandatory).

The output of each question should be in a csv format. csv names should be 1.csv, 2.csv, 3.csv, 4a.csv, 4b.csv, 5.csv, 6.csv, 7.csv. The format of each csv is given in each question. All these csv’s should be in a zip file with your name. If output is not in this format, then the solutions won’t be considered.
